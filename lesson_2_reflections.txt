Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It creates an empty repository with nothing committed. To be able to create your own repository.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: Staging area allows you to include only a specific set of files to a commit. The working directory has all of the different files that you may have. This allows you to commit changes to different files in sections that make logical sense to you. Being able to make changes to the staging area in case of a mistake allows you to not have to constantly mess with the repository which you want to keep a bit cleaner.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: You can use git diff to see the difference between what you are about to commit and what is in the working directory to see if it is a logical change. You can also compare what you are about to commit with what is already to committed to see if it is a worthwhile change.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: When you want different versions of the code that are similar but fundamentally different in some improtant way.
